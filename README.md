# 📊 SaaS Product Analytics & Insights — Case Study 
by **Dhruv Rajpoot**

This case study explores how users sign up, engage, upgrade, or churn in a SaaS product.  
The goal was to understand **activation, retention, and monetization patterns** and translate them into product decisions rather than just raw analysis.

---

## ⭐ Key Takeaways

- **Users analyzed:** 100  
- **Most common plan:** Free  
- **Peak signup months:** January & March  
- **Strongest region:** Canada  
- **Biggest issue identified:** Early-stage churn (first 30–60 days)

---

## 📈 What I Analyzed

| Area | Focus |
|-------|--------|
| **Acquisition** | Monthly signups, entry plan, top regions |
| **Retention** | Cohorts, churn %, user behavior patterns |
| **Revenue** | Plan mix, subscription upgrades, ARPU |
| **Engagement** | Most-used features and event frequency |

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Users who interact with **multiple features in the first week** show significantly higher retention.
- Free → Basic → Pro plan conversion remains low, indicating opportunity for **value messaging improvements.**
- **MRR rises in months where engagement and MAU stay stable**, showing a correlation between usage and revenue.
- Most churn happens early, suggesting issues in **onboarding clarity or perceived value.**

## 💡 Suggested Product Actions

| Recommendation | Goal |
|---------------|------|
| Improve onboarding flow | Increase activation rate |
| Add contextual upgrade nudges | Improve Free → Paid conversions |
| Run A/B tests on messaging | Validate which triggers improve engagement |
| Personalized lifecycle emails | Reduce early churn |

## 🎯 Why I Built This

As a product-focused student pursuing a PM role, I wanted to understand how **product decisions emerge from real data.**  
This project helped me practice:

- Asking the right product questions  
- Breaking data into meaningful signals  
- Connecting insights → **experiments → roadmap direction**

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Add dashboards (Mixpanel, Power BI, or Tableau)
- Build churn & retention scoring logic  
- Compare engagement across personas or feature discovery paths
